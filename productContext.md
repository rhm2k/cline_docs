# MCP Server Compatibility Investigation

## Purpose
Investigate the compatibility of various LLMs (Large Language Models) with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, specifically focusing on:
- OpenAI Models
- OpenRouter Models
- Local Models using Ollama
- Claude Models

## Key Objectives
1. Determine the compatibility of different LLM interfaces with MCP servers
2. Understand the configuration requirements for using MCP servers
3. Explore the flexibility of the MCP protocol across different model providers
