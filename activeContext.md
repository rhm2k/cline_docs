# Current Task: Obsidian MCP Server Implementation

## Current Status
- Successfully connected to both Obsidian vaults via REST API
- Implemented custom transport layer for MCP server
- Working on MCP protocol message format compatibility

## Recent Progress
- Fixed SSL certificate handling for localhost connections
- Implemented proper error handling and logging
- Verified vault connectivity with test scripts
- Created custom StdioTransport implementation
- Updated server response format to match MCP protocol

## Next Steps
1. Complete MCP protocol message format implementation
2. Test server with actual MCP client requests
3. Implement proper error responses following MCP protocol
4. Add comprehensive logging for debugging
5. Consider implementing reconnection logic for robustness

## Technical Notes
- Both vaults are accessible at localhost:27124 and localhost:27125
- SSL verification disabled for localhost connections
- Custom transport layer handles stdin/stdout communication
- Need to ensure proper JSON message format for MCP protocol
